# llm-research-and-projects
This repository consist of the projects that are implemented by Python and LangChain framework during my research on LLM's.

In this research, firstly I focused on how LLM's work and their architecture. After understanding these topics, I 
focused on the prompting tecniques and the RAG technique.

## Topics
- **How LLM's Work**
- **Transformer Architecture**
- **Pre-Tranining and Fine-Tuning**
- **Tokenization**
- **Vector Embeddings**
- **LLM Evaluation Metrics**
- **Zero-Shot, One-Shot and Few-Shot Techniques**
- **Chain of Thought Technique**
- **Self Consistency Prompting**
- **Persona Based Promting**
- **RAG Technique**

After understanding how the LLM's work, I developed 2 simple projects using **LangChain** framework and **Python**.
